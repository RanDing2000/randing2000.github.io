We extend the Neural Radiance Field, in the field of Multi-View Stereo and train in an unsupervised way, solve such ambiguity issues of correspondences among views.
<!-- I helped Anita Flynn and Thomas Watteyne build these small sensors and wrote firmware. 

Assisting Dr. Anita Flynn in [Prof. Kris Pister's](http://wsn.eecs.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} lab, I learned a lot about testing and board-debugging the GINA 2.2/b/c boards. I learned a lot from this project, from cutting traces to reflowing boards , even soldering and de-soldering components smaller than 4mm square. From Ankur Mehta, I learned a lot about serial protocols, from i2c, to SPI, UART and USB. This included writing new firmware to support new sensors and connecting across serial protocols to enable PC-sensor interaction. This was my first summer project and it was a bunch of exciting, hands-on learning. Some of my code contributions (mostly in terms of small, MSP430 C programs) may (perhaps) still be found [here](http://openwsn.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. --
